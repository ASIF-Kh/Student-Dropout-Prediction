# Title: Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success using ML Models 

## Introduction

The ML project aims to predict students' dropout and academic success using the dataset 
available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset, Ɵtled "Predict Students' Dropout 
and Academic Success," provides a comprehensive collecƟon of aƩributes related to students' 
demographic informaƟon, academic performance, and various other factors that may influence 
their educaƟonal outcomes.
By using various machine learning algorithms and techniques, the project seeks to develop 
models that can accurately predict whether a student is likely to drop out or achieve academic 
success based on the provided data. The predicƟve models will uƟlize a range of features, 
including student demographics (such as age, gender, and ethnicity), socioeconomic factors, 
educaƟonal background, study habits, and performance in previous assessments.
