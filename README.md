# Title: Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success using ML Models 

## Introduction
The ML project aims to predict students' dropout and academic success using the dataset available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset, titled "Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success," provides a comprehensive collection of attributes related to students' demographic information, academic performance, and various other factors that may influence their educational outcomes.

By using various machine learning algorithms and techniques, the project seeks to develop models that can accurately predict whether a student is likely to drop out or achieve academic success based on the provided data. The predictive models will utilize a range of features, including student demographics (such as age, gender, and ethnicity), socioeconomic factors, educational background, study habits,and performance in previous assessments.
